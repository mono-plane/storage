storage=My subsystem
storage.add=Adds the storage subsystem
storage.remove=Removes the storage subsystem
storage.cluster=A named storage cluster configuration
storage.cluster.add=Add a storage cluster configuration
storage.cluster.remove=Remove a cluster configuration
storage.cluster.debug=Enable storage diagnostics (TODO).

storage.cluster.num-tokens=This defines the number of tokens randomly assigned to this node on the ring. The more tokens, relative to other nodes, the larger the proportion of data that this node will store. You probably want all nodes to have the same numbe of tokens assuming they have equal hardware capability.
storage.cluster.hinted-handoff-enabled=http://wiki.apache.org/storage/HintedHandoff
storage.cluster.authenticator=Authentication backend, implementing IAuthenticator
storage.cluster.authorizer=Authorization backend, implementing IAuthorizer
storage.cluster.partitioner=The partitioner is responsible for distributing rows (by key) across nodes in the cluster


storage.cluster.seed-provider-class-name=any class that implements the SeedProvider interface
storage.cluster.seed-provider-seeds=Addresses of hosts that are deemed contact points


storage.cluster.listen-address=Address to bind to and tell other Cassandra nodes to connect to. You must change this if you want multiple nodes to be able to communicate!
storage.cluster.broadcast-address=Address to broadcast to other Cassandra nodes.
storage.cluster.start-native-transport=Whether to start the native transport server.
storage.cluster.native-transport-port=port for the CQL native transport to listen for clients on
storage.cluster.start-rpc=Whether to start the thrift rpc server.
storage.cluster.rpc-address=The address to bind the Thrift RPC service and native transport server -- clients connect here
storage.cluster.rpc-port=port for Thrift to listen for clients on
storage.cluster.internode-authenticator=Internode authentication backend, implementing IInternodeAuthenticator
storage.cluster.data-file-directories=Directories where Cassandra should store data on disk
storage.cluster.saved-caches-directory=saved caches directory
storage.cluster.commitlog-directory=Commit log directory
storage.cluster.commitlog-sync=commitlog-sync may be either "periodic" or "batch."
storage.cluster.commitlog-sync-period-in-ms=TODO
storage.cluster.endpoint-snitch=Set this to a class that implements IEndpointSnitch
storage.cluster.request-scheduler=Set this to a class that implements RequestScheduler
storage.cluster.server-encryption-enabled=Enable or disable inter-node encryption
storage.cluster.client-encryption-enabled=enable or disable client/server encryption.
